		<p>Hello! My name is Abraham De Paz, I’m just your average lazy freshman. I usually play video games and draw on my free time. Some of my favorite genres are Visual Novels like Muv Luv or Fate/Stay Night, flavors of the month like Cuphead and Mario Odyssey, competitive shooters like CS:GO, JRPG’s like Persona, and mobile games like Clash Royale when I’m in the bathroom. I like to draw things like anime characters and original characters. I’d like to make video games in the future. So in this website, I’d like to introduce you to the von Neumann computer architecture, and some links I like and that I hope you’ll like too!</p>
